How to use Sequencer crosstalk?

1. Inherit the Router's sequencer crosstalk library into your contract.
2. Add some functions including the setLinker, setFeesToken, approveFees(same as used in sample contract Vault).
3. Create a function to create a cross chain request using the routerSend() function of the crosstalk library.
4. Create a \_routerSyncHandler() to handle an incoming crosschain request from another chain.
5. Create a replayTransaction() function to have the capability to replay a transaction that could not be completed due to insufficient amount of gas passed into routerSend() function of the source chain.
6. Deploy the contract on both chains, set the linker address, set the fee token address, approve the fees to be spent by the contract to pay the Bridge.
7. Send some fee tokens to the contract so that it can pay the Bridge for it's services.
8. Map both the contracts together on the Sequencer Handler.
9. Now the contracts are ready to be tested.
